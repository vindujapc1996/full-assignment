<h4>Data Science</h4>
<p>Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field [1] that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data.[2] Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, as a research paradigm, as a research method, as a discipline, as a workflow, and as a profession.[4]

    Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyse actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[7][8]
    
    A data scientist is someone who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data.[9]
